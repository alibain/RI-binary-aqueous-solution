Calculate the real part of the refractive index of aquesous solutions as a function of wavelngth in the visible region and solute concentration using the effective 
oscillator model developed by Bain and Preston:

Bain, A., & Preston, T. C. (2020). The wavelength-dependent optical properties of weakly absorbing aqueous aerosol particles. Chemical Communications, 56, 8928â€“8931.https://doi.org/10.1039/d0cc02737e

Inorganic ions: NH_4^+, Ca^2+, Li^+, Mg^2+, Na^+, K^+, Cl^-, HSO_4^-, SO_4^2-, Br^-, NO_3^-, H^+

Organic solutes: Malonic acid, Glutaric acid, Citric acid, Tartaric acid, Sucrose, Mannose

Refractive index of pure water is taken from:
Daimon, M., & Masumura, A. (2007). Measurement of the refractive index of distilled water from the near-infrared region to the ultraviolet region. Applied Optics,
46(18), 3811. https://doi.org/10.1364/AO.46.003811

Input parameters: 

  solutes: for inorganic solutes each ion is entered individually. 
  
  solute mass fraction: for inorganic solutes the mass fraction of each ion is entered indivisually. 
  
  wavelength: wavelength in micrometers at which the refractive index will be calcualted.
